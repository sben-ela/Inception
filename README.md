## what are Containers ?
    Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that encapsulate an application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different computing environments. Containers provide a form of virtualization at the operating system level, enabling applications to be isolated from one another and run in a consistent environment, irrespective of the underlying infrastructure.
